The Software is a language-based instruction state machine system. It processes multiple input states and propagates these states into sequential instructions for execution. These instructions are interconnected in a graph-like structure, enabling the convergence and iterative propagation of datasets. This structure facilitates running simulations on identical input states to generate a distribution of potential output states.
